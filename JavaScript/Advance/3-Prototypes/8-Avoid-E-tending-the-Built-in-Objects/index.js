//  Avoid Extending the Built-in Objects

// Don't modify objects you don't own

// it really easy to add properties and methods to that existing object,
// but that doesn't mean that you should modify the built in objects.
// don't overwrite methods, don't add new methods or properties,
//and don't remove existing properties and methods,
// because somewhere else in alibrary you might be using, there might be code that is dependent on those methods in the built in objects.
