//Arrays
//An array in JavaScript is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. It can hold various data types and allows for dynamic resizing. Elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0.

let selectedColor = ['red', 'blue'];
selectedColor[2] = 'green'; // adding element into array

console.log(selectedColor);
